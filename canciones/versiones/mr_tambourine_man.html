Hey, Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey, Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me,
in the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.
</span>
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
vanished from my hand.
Left me blindly here to stand,
but still not sleeping.
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street's
too dead for dreaming.

Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship
My senses have been stripped
and my hands can't feel to grip
and my toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering.
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
into my own parade
cast your dancing spell my way,
I promise to go under it.
