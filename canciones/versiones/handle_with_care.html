D         C      G         D
Been beat up and battered 'round,
          C            G         D
been sent up, and I've been shot down
C                          G         Em
You're the best thing that I've ever found;
C      D       G
handle me with care

D     C     G      D
Reputations changeable,
    C      G     D
situations tolerable
C                 G   Em
But baby, you're adorable;
C              D       
handle me with care
<span class="puente">
G      B7       C     D
I'm so tired of being lonely,
G       B7        C       D
I still have some love to give
G         B7      C        D      G
Won't you show me that you really care
</span><span class="estribillo">
     C                        G
Everybody's, got somebody, to lean on
         C                       D
Put your body, next to mine, and dream on
</span>
D                C        G         D
I've been fobbed off, and I've been fooled,
          C          G   D
I've been robbed and ridiculed
C                   G         Em
In day care centers and night schools;
C      D       G
handle me with care

D             C         G     D
Been stuck in airports, terrorized,
        C         G    D
sent to meetings, hypnotized
C            G        Em
Overexposed, commercialized;
C              D       
handle me with care
<span class="puente">
G      B7       C     D
I'm so tired of being lonely,

G         B7      C        D      G
Won't you show me that you really care

            C         G      D
I've been uptight and made a mess,
         C             G       Em
but I'll clean it up myself, I guess
C             G           Em
Oh, the sweet smell of success;
C      D       G
handle me with care
